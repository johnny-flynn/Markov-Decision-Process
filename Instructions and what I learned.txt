To run this code, All you have to do is type: python3.7 MDP.py

Learning Outcome: This particular project was challenging for me to wrap my mind around. I understood the equation but when it came to actually sitting down and
trying to transfer the barebones logic into code, I struggled. After spending some time drawing out operations over the weekend it clicked and I was able to sit 
down and transfer that table operations based off the different moves inside looping for if else statements. I enjoy state diagrams and I liked tackling the idea of some
randomness being intruduced. Similar to the prolog assignment I plan to continue to play with these. (I also learned that I should have heeded your warning about 
not taking one of the early programming assignments off as I have been very busy and was lucky to finish this.)

My favorite thing about CS463: I really enjoied that we were able to really get hands on applicable programming experience. I have taken plenty of classes where 
we do learn allot of great things, however we rarely make the jump to apply it to actual code. The projects were rarly simple and I have spent allot of time working
 through them but I am a better programmer for it. I also really like the format of the final/midterm where we get to do some individual research into topics we are 
 interested in. Finally, I liked that ethics were included.
